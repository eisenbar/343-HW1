Useful commands while using git
1. git status
2. git add <file to add>
3. git commit -m "Message about commit"
4. git checkout -b <branch name>
5. git branch
6. git push origin <branch name>
7. git pull origin master
  
  All of these commands help see the status of your repo, add files and branches to your repo through commits and branches, and pushing these branches to gitHub to to added to the master branch. This can then be put back on your desktop to see what others have done and mess with it on your own as well. Git is a great version control system useful from groups of people.
